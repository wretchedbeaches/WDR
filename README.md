      - Go to http://geojson.io/ and draw your geofences. You MUST add a "name" field to each geofence. If you want to use sub areas (smaller detailed geofences within larger geofences), you must add a sub_area field and then true or false as the value. All geofences must be in geojson format.

      - Grant Permissions and invite bots to all servers you will be running on. (Bot needs administrator privileges) https://finitereality.github.io/permissions-calculator/?v=0

## 6: Channels
   - Fill out each channels.ini file with the channels, chosen filter, and areas. If you do not want to filter by area, use the name that you gave your discord in discords.json.
      - channels_pokemon.ini
      - channels_raids.ini
      - channels_quests.ini
      - channels_lures.ini
      - channels_invasion.ini

## 7: Filters
  In /filters you will find examples of spawns, quest, and raid feeds. These files can be named whatever you want, there is no more name requirement. These are spawn filters based on PA type, also with a min_iv and max_iv override. If you do not include a Channel_ID, the bot will ignore the filter.

  #### Quests
   - The "Type" field must be "quest".
   - Quest feeds can be filtered by reward and/or encounter. Add each reward our encounter to the "Rewards" array.
   - They are case sensitive, so please see examples. Refer to /static/en.json for all rewards.

  #### Raids
   - The "Type field must be "raid".
   - Raids can be filtered by type, levels, and ex eligibility.
   - If you DO NOT want to filter by Ex Eligibility, REMOVE the "Ex_Eligible" field completely from the filter.
   - You can add as many or as few levels to the filter as you with 1-5 as the examples show.
   - The "Egg_Or_Boss" field must be set to either "boss" or "egg".

  #### Spawns
   - This WebhookDataReceiver uses PA type filters with some overrides in the config.
   - The "Type" field must be "monster".
   - You must set the min_iv and max_iv for the filter. Defaults `0` and `100`.
   - You must set the min_level and max_level for the filter. Defaults `0` and `35`.
   - More specific IVs can be set for each monster (replace `True`/`False` with `{"min_iv":"80"}`), but that value must be within the min_iv and max_iv you set.
   - You can set the bot to post without IVs using the "Post_Without_IV" field. Set this to `true` or `false`.
